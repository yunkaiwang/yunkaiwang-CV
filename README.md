Yunkai Wang
==================================================

## Who I am

I am an up-and-coming __software developer__ with a strong academic background in __algorithm__. I am currently persuing a master of computer science degree from Carleton University. I am expected to graduate in June 2021.

You can view my full resume [here](https://github.com/yunkaiwang/yunkaiwang-CV/raw/master/yunkaiwang_resume.pdf).


## About the Template

My resume uses the [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template by @posquit0 which uses the fonts [Roboto](https://github.com/google/roboto), [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro), and [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome). Compiling the PDFs probably requires [XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/).

My version of the repo is forked from [CV](https://github.com/cbarrick/CV) made by @cbarrick.
