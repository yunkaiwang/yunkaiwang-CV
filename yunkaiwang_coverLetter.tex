\lettersection{About Me}
I am currently enrolled as a Master's student at Carleton. My anticipated graduation date is June 2021.
I have an outstanding academic performance at school, both as an undergraduate student and a
graduate student. I have received the Entrance Scholarship from Carleton in full amount, and I was
awarded the Senate Medal when I finished my Bachelor's study. I have completed a total of
four co-op work terms at three different companies with hands-on experience with many large-scale
projects. I developed a keen interest in advanced data structures and algorithms, and I can effectively
apply them in real applications for performance improvement. I am also skilled in object-oriented
programming and deployment and development of web applications; I launched a lost-and-found
mobile app using Express and React Native, and I have also integrated BigBlueButton with open
source platforms like Zimbra and Open Edx. I am always passionate to learn cutting-edge technologies
and apply them in projects and systems. I have refined my strengths in project management,
technical troubleshooting, and problem resolution through my years of professional experience.


\lettersection{Why <company>?}


\lettersection{Why Me?}
With my wide-ranging technical skills, superior capacity to tackle time-sensitive projects, and proven
ability to deliver best-in-class customer service, I am confident that I will exceed your expectations
from my first day on the job.
